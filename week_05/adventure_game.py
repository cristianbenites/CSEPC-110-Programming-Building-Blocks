"""
The class Scenario set each level with its content, questions and possible answers (which are other Scenarios).
It also is prepared for invalid inputs and accepts the words QUIT and EXIT to exit the game.
Once and input matches the dictionary of Level options, it executes the proper chosen Scenario
When a Scenario doesn't have children (option paths), it its considered end game, so the text content is printed
as well as the final message.
